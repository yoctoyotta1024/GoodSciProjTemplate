Getting Started
===============

Clone GoodSciProjTemplate's GitHub repository:

.. code-block:: console

  $ git clone https://github.com/yoctoyotta1024/GoodSciProjTemplate.git

and install the pre-commit hooks:
.. code-block:: console
  
  $ pre-commit install

That's it, you're done! But maybe now you want to customise the project
and push it to your own GitHub repo...

Necessary first steps:
###########################

#. Create an empty GitHub repository and push your new project to it.
#. Make yourself the ``github.repository_owner`` who triggers GitHub's CI to publish documentation (see `.github/workflows/CI.yml`).
#. Set your documentation to deploy using the `/(root)` folder of your gh-pages branch (see instructions `here <https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site>`_)
#. Checkout to a new branch using git and start customising the template...

Necessary second steps:
#######################

#. Make the project name yours instead of "GoodSciProjTemplate".
#. Make the release/version yours instead of "0.0.0".
#. Make the citation and liscence refer to you instead of me.
#. Write a new README.md (shorter is generally better) and include a link to your documentation in it.
#. Change the GitHub links in the .rst files to the correct ones for your GitHub repository (*hint*: you find these files in the `docs` directory).

Some suggested third steps:
###########################
#. Change the names of the C++ and Python package names in the `libs` directory (maybe you also prefer to call "libs" "src"?)
#. If you made a C++ library, set your ```INPUT``` in `doxygen.dox` and your ``breathe_projects`` and/or ``default_breathe_projects`` in `conf.py` to match the name of the new C++ library.
#. Make a new Python or C++ module/subpackage (include docstrings and write unit tests in the `tests` directory!).
#. Create an associated .rst file for your new module/subpackage (somewhere in the `docs/source` directory).
#. Add the path to your new .rst file to the contents of the ``.. toctree::`` in `index.rst`.
#. Push your changes to a branch of your GitHub repository (not main!).
#. Create a pull request (and accept it if your tests pass) to merge your changes with the main branch of your GitHub repository.
#. Be proud of your new code with documentation and tests.


Want more ideas?!
#################
Have you thought about adding contributors, acknowledgements, more Python and/or
other requirements / enviroments, more CI or pre-commit tasks, and an automatic file header
generator? Or maybe you should ponder it all over a cup of tea and some biscuits...
