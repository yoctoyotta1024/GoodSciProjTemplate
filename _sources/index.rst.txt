.. GoodSciProjTemplate documentation master file, based off sphinx-quickstart.
   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to GoodSciProjTemplate's Documentation!
===============================================

.. note::
   Please consider that this project is under active development
   and our documentation is a work in progress.

   This documentation is built from the latest code in the main branch of the repository.
   It does not necessarily reflect a released version, and there may be short-commings when compared
   to the on-going code development. If you have queries related to
   this or if there is anything you wish to report please please :ref:`contact us! <contact>`.

This library aims to be a template to make it easy and quick for you to incorporate best coding and
scientific practises into your GitHub repositories. The template demonstrates:

* what to include in file headers
* how to document your Python and C++ code
* how to make tests for your code (using Python)
* how to liscence your code
* how to make a citation for your code
* things to include in .gitignore (e.g. large files like jupyter notebooks)
* how to list the requirements of your code (i.e. dependencies) and make a Python environment .yml file
* how to use pre-commit for code formatting (see https://pre-commit.com/)
* how to use continuous integration (CI) to run your tests and publish your documentation on GitHub (see https://docs.github.com/en/actions/automating-builds-and-tests/about-continuous-integration)

To (locally) reproduce this project, simply clone the repository. You will need to run
``pre-commit install`` but other than that all the necessary packages for you to run & have fun with
everything should work out of the box... If not, please raise an issue on the
GitHub repository.

Time to get involved! Check out the :doc:`getting started page<usage/getstart>`.
